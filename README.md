# ArchMedica Lab

ArchMedica is an educational Linux server made to learn and practice Linux as a server and OS. Everything in this project was made with the intention to learn and not as a real production server.

This serves was crated by scratch using ArchLinux as a OS for the Server and Linux Mint as the client.
