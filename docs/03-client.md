# Client - ArchMedica

## Objective

Creating an external client with a different Linux distribution to simulate a real job environmnet. This client will have a dummy software simulating an interaccition betwen user and software.
Linux Mint was selected because the server was the practice for installing a minimalist OS. I did not install again Arch Linux for the client to avoid using a single distribution. 
The main purpose of the lab is to learn Linux, not only Arch.
Windows enterprise was not selected due to hardware limitations.

## Environment

- Platform: Virtaul Machine
- Boot Mode: BIOS Legacy
- Installation Method: Automatic installer

## Installation approach

No mayor changes were made to the automatic installation given by Linux Mint Installer
No mayor issues were found

## Other role

The main purpose of this client is to simulate a real job environment, however, this VM is also used to document the lab and updating the github repository.
